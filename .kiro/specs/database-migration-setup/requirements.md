# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Legato platform backend is experiencing database connectivity issues because the required database tables have not been created. The application is trying to query the "users" table which doesn't exist in the PostgreSQL database. This spec addresses the immediate need to set up proper database migrations and ensure all required tables are created and properly configured.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automatic Database Initialization on Server Start

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database to be automatically initialized when the server starts, so that I don't need to run separate migration commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the FastAPI server starts THEN the system SHALL automatically connect to PostgreSQL using environment variables
2. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL automatically create all database tables if they don't exist
3. WHEN tables are created THEN the system SHALL use SQLAlchemy metadata to generate the schema from models
4. WHEN the database connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and prevent server startup
5. WHEN tables already exist THEN the system SHALL verify the schema matches the models and continue startup

### Requirement 2: Automatic Schema Creation from Models

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database tables automatically created from SQLAlchemy models, so that the schema stays in sync with the code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL automatically create the users table with all required fields
2. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL automatically create the books table with proper author relationships
3. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL automatically create the chapters table linked to books
4. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL automatically create the user_library table for book ownership
5. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL automatically create the comments table with threading support
6. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL automatically create the transactions table for payment tracking
7. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL automatically create the bookmarks table for reading progress
8. WHEN tables are created THEN the system SHALL automatically create all necessary indexes for performance

### Requirement 3: Database Connection and Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper database connection handling, so that the application can reliably connect to PostgreSQL.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL establish a connection to PostgreSQL using environment variables
2. WHEN database credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
3. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry logic
4. WHEN the application shuts down THEN the system SHALL properly close database connections
5. WHEN multiple requests are made THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling for efficiency

### Requirement 4: Data Validation and Integrity

**User Story:** As a developer, I want data integrity constraints, so that the database maintains consistent and valid data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user data is inserted THEN the system SHALL enforce unique constraints on email and username
2. WHEN foreign key relationships are created THEN the system SHALL enforce referential integrity
3. WHEN required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL reject the database operation
4. WHEN data types don't match THEN the system SHALL provide validation errors
5. WHEN duplicate entries are attempted THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts gracefully

### Requirement 5: Migration Rollback and Recovery

**User Story:** As a developer, I want migration rollback capabilities, so that I can recover from failed or incorrect migrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide rollback functionality
2. WHEN rollback is executed THEN the system SHALL restore the previous database state
3. WHEN migration conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution steps
4. WHEN database corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL provide recovery procedures
5. WHEN migrations are rolled back THEN the system SHALL update the migration history accordingly
